title: Ball sorting machine                             # required | text | A title to identify the thing

description: |                             # required | paragraph
  The “ball-sorting machine” is a work-in-progress concept of a purely mechanical machine capable of sorting balls by weight order using a selection of sorting algorithms.  

intended-use: |                            # recommended | Paragraph
  It aims to deliver museum visitors a hands-on and visual experience of different sorting algorithms. Balls with different weights are dropped in a series of comparators sorting them simply using gravitational force. The visitor can reiterate the sorting with different machine configurations in order to compare the working principles of the sorting algorithms and therewith understand their differences.
